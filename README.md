Gringotts

I am 29 years old, male, from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
I graduated from the University of Oklahoma
with a degree in Political Science and a minor in Middle Eastern Studies.
So, naturally, it should come as no surprise that I work in the Oil & Gas industry.
That's what Poli Sci is for, right?
I am learning to code as a means to broaden my horizons, try new things,
diversify myself, and achieve my goals.
